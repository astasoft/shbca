```

```
$ ./shbca.sh -a logout

```

## Using Config File

Instead of inputing username, password and other options directly when calling shbca, you can put the option value in configuration file by specifying it using
`-c` option.

As an example below is checking account with auto login using config file named `shbca.config`.

```
$ ./shbca.sh -a check_balance_wlogin -c ./shbca.config
Logged in to Klik BCA
Account number: 1234567890. Balance left: 799,989,310.29
Logged out from Klik BCA
```

At minimum you should only need three values on your config file.

```
#!/bin/bash
#
# shbca config file

# Klik BCA Username
BCA_LOGIN_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"

# Klik BCA Password
BCA_LOGIN_PASSWORD="YOUR_PASSWORD"

# Klik BCA Origin IP
# Leave empty to get default public ip address from wtfismyip.com/text
BCA_LOGIN_IP=8.8.8.8
```

For list of detailed example of other available configuration you can take a look the content of `shbca.config.sample` file.

## Security

Your Klik BCA username and password are very sensitive information.
That's why shbca never log those information in clear text in the log file.
shbca automatically replace it with asterisk characters `******`.

If you are using config file for storing your Klik BCA username and password,
make sure only you that can read the file. Change the permission to very minimal
such as `0600`. Assuming the name of the config file is `shbca.config`.

```
$ chmod 0600 shbca.config
```
